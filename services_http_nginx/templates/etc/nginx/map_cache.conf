### Testing if we should be serving content from cache or not. This is
### needed for any Drupal setup that uses an external cache.

## Testing the request method. Only GET and HEAD are caching safe.
map $request_method $no_cache1 {
    default 0;
    POST 1; # POST requests aren't cached usually
}

## Testing for the session cookie being present. If there is then no
## caching is to be done.
map $http_cookie $no_cache2 {
    default 0;
    ~SESS 1; # PHP session cookie
    NO_CACHE 1; # we enforced a NO_CACHE mode (after a post in Drupal with cookie_cache_bypass_adv module)
}
